## Developing your own cookbook.


## Two Types of Cookbook setups
1. Cookbook that runs on a TACC hpc system. 
2. Cookbook that runs on a Streamlit

We'll focus on the first type of cookbook.


## TACC HPC Cookbook
If you need lots of computation power or a lot of memory, you can use the TACC HPC system.

## Streamlit Cookbook
If you need to provide a simple analysis tool, you can use the Streamlit Cookbook.
These will have low computation power and memory requirements.
